# outside-in-tictactoe

This is a playground project that was started as a session on Outside-In-TDD (Mockist/ London-school/ Acceptance-Test-Driven) 
in the formidable 1st Software Engineering Camp (https://www.swe-camp.de, https://twitter.com/hashtag/SWEC16).

It works on the tic-tac-toe Kata as specified here:
http://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/application-katas/tic-tac-toe/

The code and commit history probably reflect pretty well that this is about experimenting with the outside-in concept, 
unit-testing in general, the python mocking framework and some other coding questions.
